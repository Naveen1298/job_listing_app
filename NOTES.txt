Login Credentials are same as mentioned in the API Document

"email" : "emailforapi@gigin.ai" , 
"password" : "65$az"

------------

-I have implemented the login page and navigation
-Also Job Listings implemented along with apply feature.
-And implmented My Jobs also. When we click on Apply on Job Listings. those jobs are listed in My Jobs Section.
-I have implemented POST Action for Login.
-Until last I didn't notice that you have shared API document in link format. So, I used mockData to display data. But I know CRUD operations using REST API
